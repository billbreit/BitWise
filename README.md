### BitWise

A toolkit for creating small footprint, high performance applications with Binary Logic on Python and MicroPython platforms. 

So far, I've added:

* a working version of bitlogic.py, for debugging binary logic apps and as a compendium of bit logic idioms.

* a early beta version of ListStore, a generic 'multi-list' structure illustrating binarary logic techniques for compact, high-performance data structures.
